# react-gh-pages-template

This repository is the template for all of my GitHub Pages sites.

## Important dependencies

This project uses react-bootstrap for frontend styling.

react-snap is used to pre-render the entire page into static sources that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

gh-pages handles building and deploying the static sources to a separate GitHub branch.
